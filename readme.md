This is my 'hacked up merge' of UAE 0.6.8 and Basilisk I.
The whole point is that both of these emulators share
the same 68000 emulation core from UAE 0.6.8

The eventual goal would be to move both of thest to a newer
and more accurate emulator and perhaps add in fixes and 
features from later versions.

The upside being things like better 68030/68040 68881/68882
and MMU emulation.

This includes the bare minimum needed to build and run.
You'll need to bring your own ROMS and OS.
